## Summary about "good-developer-mindset" article

Being a true developer needs a lot of work to acomplish. That doesn't mean it's hard, but we need to think differently than other people. To simplify the way we think, we have to consider few things:

- The goal should be clear and simple. We have to clearify the purpose of the project and make sure we understod it well. Because when we know what we're doing, the job will be organized and clear to anyone.

- The code itself should be simple and consistent. Comlexity isn't a good thing, it will make the code hard to understand or modify if needed. The simple code that perform a specefic task correctly is far better than the complicated one that does the same tsk with no-need additional small tasks. Also, the code have to be consistent with its contents, so it should clearify that the same mind had written the whole code.

- Priorzation is very important too. Make sure you understand and notice the ammount of time needed to finish the new additional task before you add it to the project. Also, its affect on the project should be suited for the time needed.

- Try and test your project as much as you can. In this way, you will discover the hidden errors and fix them. But even if you couldn't, try everything before start asking for help.  

- Make yourself comfortable. Don't do the things in hard way and trying to create everything, a lot of people have done most of your work for you and post it online on some website. We can use help according to this table:

| The problem | From where can I solve it |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| can't organize my files with the team | use Git and Github |
| one common subtask in the code may take a long time | search on Stack Overflow |
| I'm stuck on some coding problem | post it on Stack Overflow |
